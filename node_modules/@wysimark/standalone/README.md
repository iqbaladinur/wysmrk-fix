## Usability

### Button Tooltips with hints and shortcuts

Hovering over the toolbar displays helpful tooltips and keyboard shortcuts. Window, Linux and Mac each get their own OS specific shortcuts following the conventions of each operating system.

### Sticky Dropdown Menus with Hints and shortcuts

Menus stay closed until they are clicked open and then they stay open as you hover over other menu buttons. This makes discoverability in menus fast, easy and it works like your operating system. Drop down menus show icons, hints and device operating system dependant shortcuts.

## Image and Attachment Uploading

Wysimark supports image and file uploading using Portive, a service created by the creator of Wysimark to an Amazon AWS S3 Bucket. Wysimark supports three intuitive ways to upload images to Wysimark.

### Upload from Toolbar

### Paste Images and Files

Copy and paste images from anywhere in your operating system directly into the editor to start uploading.

## Easy Image Resizing

### Drag to Resize

Grab a resize handle on the image and drag to resize.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portive/wysimark-assets/main/readme/image-resize-drag@2x.jpg" width="545">

The current width and height of the image are shown as you drag.

An image, resized and optimized in the cloud, will be delivered to the user based on the final width and height.

### Preset: Resize to Fixed Width

You can provide a set of preset shortcuts to your users with fixed bounds that users can click.

In this example, we provide S, M and L sizes and M is set to have bounds of 320x320. Based on this image, the preset value shows 320x213.

### Preset: Resize to Fraction

You can also provide a set of preset shortcuts to your users with fractional sizes that users can click. This is useful, for example, if a user takes a screenshot in a high DPI device (e.g. 2x) and the use wants to resize it to exactly half the uploaded size so as to maintain a 1 to 1 size in the editor.
